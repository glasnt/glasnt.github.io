<h1>Human Bio</h1>
Here's where I can actually put down a bit about myself, my interests, hobbies, etc. 
<br/><br/>
I actually have no idea what to put here.
</br><br>
I know, Memory Lane!
</br><br>
I've always enjoyed making technology work for me. As a young child, I remember being absolutely chuffed that I could <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/comp.speech/Section5/Synth/monologue.html">make a computer talk</a>. There were a few computers in the house, but only one had a graphical user interface. I started teaching about technology when I had to show my mother how to undo the <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme/">custom theme</a> changes I had made. 
</p><p>
I have a degree in Information Technology, but a lot of what I did at university was the application of technology in other disiplines: using wikis as a documentation tool to assist in management, the science and psychology behind web marketing, how animation works. 
</p><p>
I started my professional software development career converting the human process of data collection via spreadsheets into basic web-based data collection forms. The tech stack for this was... not something I want to use in the future.
</p><p>
After a few years of that, I was given the opportunity to do system administration for a managed hosting provider, tending to their Windows fleet. There was a lot of repetition and manual work involved, so between support tickets, I started automating things. I made windows versions of some of the apps they were using on the Linux side: <a href="https://github.com/glasnt/wail2ban">wail2ban</a> (based on <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">fail2ban</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/glasnt/twingle">twingle</a> (based on <a href="https://github.com/anchor/tingle">tingle</a>).
</p>
<p>Automating all the things got a bit of attention, and I was moved from the support team into the engineering department. I started working with Python, Ruby, Haskell, web application development, and more Linux than I could shake a stick at. 
</p>
<p>
During this time, I was fortunate enough to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Developers%27_Conference">OSDC2013</a>. I saw an amazing, humourous and interesting talk about using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj9_EIlc_NU">Cython for distributed-multiprocess steganographic md5sum-collision generation</a>[1]. On the final day of the conference at the hotel bar, I was speaking with a random person, and I mentioned how this conference had been awesome, citing the Cython talk, and how I thought I could possibly speak at the next one. Little did I know that I was actually speaking with the person that started OSDC itself. Eep. That conversation was a catalyst for a life-changing experience.  </p>
<p>
Since then, I have spoken at a number of local meetups, national events, and international conferences. I have met some absolutely amazing people, done some amazing things, and my life has been changed for the better. I've learnt so much about technology, people, and myself, that I have no idea who I would be if it were not for that one talk and that one conversation.</p>
<p>

Outside of work, I do enjoy hacking on tech. I've made a few <a href="http://gyprock.glasnt.com/">fun</a> little <a href="https://github.com/glasnt/octohat">projects</a>, and I do like getting my hands dirty with building my gaming rig, or playing with Arduino.
</p><p>
And yes, I do actually enjoy <a href="http://forums.overclockers.com.au/showthread.php?t=1162025">cooking</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/u9IEL">making tapestries</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx0yt0YsDnA">yelling at JavaScript and its attempt at global variables</a>.
